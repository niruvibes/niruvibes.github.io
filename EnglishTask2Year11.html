            <h3>What is this idk is this a plan</h3>
            <p>
            O what is that sound
            </p>
            <p>
                -          Selfishness
            </p>
            <p>
                -          
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>O’ what is that sound offers a power insight, that we as individuals are willing to sidelines our values and other to survive</li>
                <li>before studying the module, I believed that only leaders where self-interested, not caring and serving their duties. However, o’ what is that sound shows how profoundly selfish we are.</ol>
                <li>The poem highlights a line saying, “where does vows you swore deceiving deceiving?”- This resonated with my insight of the narrative of war as in this situation a husband has broken the sacred bond between a wife and husband to survive. He leaves his wife, kneeling on the ground as he runs away, further prolonging his inevitable death, instead of sticking to his vows and staying with her till the very end.</ol>
                <li>This poem also resonated with my viewing of the Captain America viewing, specifically with the scene where Steve Rogers jumps onto a grenade. This was an important scene as a scene before, colonel Phillips argues with the scientist Erskine reasoning on selecting Steve. He throws a fake grenade causing everyone but Steve to run away, instead he jumps on it, putting the lives of others in front of his own, showcasing that he is the true heroes, and not the other men who traditionally fit the role.</ol>

            The true nature of power, within grand narratives of war, is questioned by
            prompting new insights from modern-day viewers questioning the truth about the
            self-centeredness of not only the political elite, but also the everyday man.
            </p>
            <p>
            Freud’s analysis of totalitarian political leaders showcases the inherently
            manipulative, insidious nature of the tyrant motivated by the intoxicating
            ability of control, attempting to warp the moral sides of humanity into what
            they deem as perfect.. I picked up this new insight through the poem, “Unknown
            Citizen”, which represents the story of an individual who has been created as a
            propagandistic tool to convince others into conforming, becoming the ideal human
            in the eyes of the government. Throughout the poem we are confronted with the
            true extent of the locus of power that the government has over the people. The
            aside “Our report on his Union shows it was sound”, reveals to us how something
            that is meant to be free of political interference have been meddled with.
            </p>
            <p>
            We as readers are offered a view into how the grand narrative of war is
            manipulated as a technique of storytelling to coerce us as individuals to give
            into our primal instincts and abandon all the values we keep close as a way of
            surviving in situations of tyrannical leadership. One such example of this
            action is in ‘O what is that sound that so thrills the ear’ by WH Auden. Auden
            utilizes the poetry form as a story telling method, to convey the selfishness of
            humanity in a dear attempt to survive. In this situation, the man’s desire for
            survival has led him to abandon his wife on her knees as she attempts to find
            any form of support, as their house and lives get torn to bits by the impending
            army sent by the ruler. Auden’s use of the line, “where the vows you swore
            deceiving, deceiving”, is a connection to the abandonment that she is feeling in
            her state of fear and panic. Traditional wedding vows express never leaving your
            partner, “in sickness and in health”, however the husband here has broken the
            sanctity of his marriage, fear has put him in such a sense of hysteria it has
            caused him to throw away everything that he loves in a dying attempt at
            self-preservation. His thought process has been overridden by fear and anxiety
            and he has become self-interested as his only way of survival. In contradiction
            to Captain America, in the “grenade scene”, Colonel Phillips utilizes the
            falling on a grenade test, in an attempt to prove that the soldier “Hodge”
            deserves the serum as he is seen as the “perfect soldier” as “he's big, he's
            fast, he obeys orders”. However in attempting to prove Hodge as the better
            soldier, he reveals that Steve is better as he attempts to cover the grenade
            with his body, accepting himself as the ultimate sacrifice to save the
            others,proving how selfless he is, directly opposing the husband from O what is
            that sound.The same cannot be said for the other soldiers as they attempt to
            push and shove others as a method of surviving from the grenade, a direct
            parallel to the husband from O what is that sound. In a typical marriage, the
            husband is typically seen as the one who protects the family from harm, being
            the hero figure, however, he has left her on her knees, praying to a higher
            power in a search for another protective figure as he has left her to prolong
            the time until his eventual death.
